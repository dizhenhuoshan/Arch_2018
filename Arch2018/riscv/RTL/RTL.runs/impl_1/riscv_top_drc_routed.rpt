2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net cpu0/ex_mem0/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin cpu0/ex_mem0/mem_cnt_o_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell cpu0/ex_mem0/mem_cnt_o_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check
